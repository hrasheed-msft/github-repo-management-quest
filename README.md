# GitHub Copilot for Repository Management Quest

## Quest Overview

Welcome to the **GitHub Copilot for Repository Management Quest** - an interactive learning experience designed for content developers who want to master GitHub Copilot's native features for repository management workflows. This quest simulates real-world scenarios that content teams face daily, from taking over unfamiliar repositories to managing complex pull requests and issue backlogs.

**What makes this quest unique:** You'll learn to leverage GitHub Copilot's workspace agent, PR summarization, issue analysis, and automated code generation features - all within your natural GitHub workflow.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this quest, you will:

1. **Master GitHub Copilot workspace exploration** - Use Copilot's @workspace agent to quickly understand unfamiliar repositories and documentation structures
2. **Develop advanced PR review skills** - Leverage GitHub Copilot's PR summaries, review suggestions, and inline chat for efficient pull request reviews
3. **Implement efficient issue management** - Use Copilot to analyze issues, suggest fixes, and even generate PRs automatically from issue descriptions
4. **Create documentation standards** - Establish quality standards with Copilot-assisted reviews and automated checks
5. **Build practical workflows** - Develop repeatable processes using GitHub Copilot's native capabilities

## Quest Structure

This quest contains three progressive scenarios, each building on skills from the previous one:

### Scenario 1: The Inheritance
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

You've just been assigned to take over a documentation repository from a team member who left suddenly. The repository contains dozens of markdown files, some Python utilities, and no clear structure. Your mission: understand what you've inherited, identify issues, and create an actionable improvement plan.

**Tasks:**
- 1.1: Explore and map the repository structure using GitHub Copilot's @workspace agent
- 1.2: Identify outdated content, broken links, and inconsistencies with Copilot Chat
- 1.3: Generate a comprehensive content audit report using Copilot
- 1.4: Create documentation standards with Copilot's assistance

### Scenario 2: The Big Merge
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

A contributor has submitted a massive pull request touching 15+ markdown files across multiple documentation sections. The changes include new tutorials, updated guides, and restructured content. You need to review this PR efficiently, identify issues, and guide the contributor to success.

**Tasks:**
- 2.1: Use GitHub Copilot's PR summary and review features for initial assessment
- 2.2: Leverage Copilot inline suggestions to identify style and technical issues
- 2.3: Use Copilot to draft constructive review comments and suggestions
- 2.4: Validate cross-references with @workspace context awareness

### Scenario 3: The Backlog Battle
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced

Your documentation repository has accumulated 25+ open issues over the past few months. They range from typo fixes to requests for new content, from bug reports to feature suggestions. Your challenge: triage this backlog efficiently and create a sustainable issue management process.

**Tasks:**
- 3.1: Use Copilot to bulk categorize and prioritize the issue backlog
- 3.2: Leverage Copilot to identify duplicates and relationships between issues
- 3.3: Generate issue templates with Copilot's assistance
- 3.4: Use Copilot to draft responses and even create fix PRs directly from issues

## Prerequisites

- **Git fundamentals**: Basic understanding of repositories, commits, branches, and pull requests
- **Markdown knowledge**: Familiarity with markdown syntax and documentation
- **GitHub Copilot**: Active GitHub Copilot subscription (individual, business, or enterprise)
- **Tools**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension, Git client, GitHub account

**Optional but helpful:**
- Experience with documentation systems (MkDocs, Jekyll, Docusaurus)
- Basic Python knowledge for understanding utility scripts
- Prior experience with code review processes

## Quest Format
